Simple Vagrant
=========

A simple Vagrant instance.

To run:
- Git clone the project,
- edit bootstrap.sh to suit your project,
- put your project source code to "/projects" folder,
- go into the "../vagrant" folder,
- edit Vagrantfile to meet your research hardware requirement,
- run "vagrant up"
- wait until the box has finished provisioning
- ENJOY Script C (read:Skripsi xD)

To run multiple machine:
- Go into the "/vagrant-nmachine",
- to connect to machine run "vagrant ssh 'your-machine-name'"
